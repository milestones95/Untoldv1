        Nyomi's Lesbian Story
      <Typography component="div">
        My hands gripped the steering wheel as I stared out through my windshield and took a deep breath. “You can do this, Nyomi. She’s only one person.” I let out a deep breath and turned off the car, shoving the keys into my pocket and slamming the door behind me.

        My girlfriend, Stacy, has been working at her job for a few years now. Everything was great until her old boss decided to retire and they brought in someone new: Mia. She’s been making Stacey’s work life a living hell ever since she jumped into the role about six months ago. Every night, Stacey comes home and tells me all about how Mia tried to ruin her life that day.
        ‍
        At first, I couldn’t believe it. When I had met Mia at the company holiday party, she seemed so sweet and genuine. Apparently, all that changed for some reason after that night.

        Steadying myself, I start the ascent up Mia’s driveway. Her house is huge and beautiful. Stacey doesn’t know I’m here. I made sure to do this on Mia’s day off while Stacey was busy at work. Before I raise my hand to knock on her front door, I feel a quick pang of regret and pull my hand back. I don’t even know for sure if Mia is home, I’m walking into this completely blind. Ugh, maybe this was a bad idea. I should just--

        As I turn around to leave, a bright red sports car pulls out of the garage. Mia backs onto her driveway but stops when our eyes meet. I’m caught now, so I might as well follow through.

        She gets out of her car, looking me up and down with those steel-blue eyes. “Hello,” she says, keeping her tone even and aloof.

        “Hi,” I nod politely, “I’m not sure if you remember me but I’m--”

        “Stacey’s girlfriend, right?” Mia cuts me off, extending her hand. “I remember you from the holiday party.”

        “Nyomi,” I tell her as we shake hands briefly and she narrows her eyes at me.

        “Is there a reason you’re here, at my house?” She asks, withdrawing her hand. “Can I do something for you?”

        My mouth goes dry as I try to speak. I hate confrontation so I’m a little nervous. “It’s about Stacey.”

        Mia raises an eyebrow, the corner of her lips turning upward in a sly smirk. “Oh?”

        “Yes,” I say, crossing my arms. “Every night she comes home to me and tells me all about the ways you target her in the workplace. Why? Stacey is a remarkable employee, I know that because her old boss loved her. What is it about her that you hate so much?”

        Mia looks around before nodding toward her open garage. “Let’s take this discussion inside, please. I don’t need to give my neighbors anything new to gossip about.”

        I follow her into the garage and through the door into her kitchen. It’s gorgeous, I can tell that Mia not only has loads of money but impeccable taste.

        “Can I get you anything? Coffee, tea, sparkling water?” She asks, taking on the role of a proper hostess. “

        You can get me answers,” I tell her, trying to remain firm. “What is it about Stacey that rubs you the wrong way? Is it because she’s younger than you? Is a woman as successful as you really so threatened by her own employee?”

        Mia laughs a genuine and melodic laugh. “Threatened? God, no.” She says, wiping a tear from her eye. She approaches me, her tone serious as her eyes practically nail me to the wall. “When I was Stacey’s age I was second in command of my department, and I was promoted to department head only two years later. The youngest in the history of the company.”

        “Then what is it?” I ask, trying to keep my eyes trained on Mia’s. I back up, feeling somewhat intimidated. Mia might be a terrible person, but she was hot as hell. She was built like an hourglass and her huge tits only served to make her figure even more pronounced. I’d guess they were at least a D-cup. Her long, blonde hair was down in loose curls today, different from the formal, reserved chignons and ponytails I’d usually see when I dropped Stacey off at work.

        Mia closed in on me until I could feel the counter behind me pressing into my back. “Stacey does have one thing I didn’t have when I was her age, though.”

        “And- and that is?” I ask, catching the smell of Mia’s fruity perfume. It’s a heady scent that almost makes my knees buckle, peach, and citrus. My mouth waters as I absentmindedly wonder how it would feel to sink my teeth into her. “

        A hot little girlfriend,” she answers. Before I can process what she’s said, her lips are on mine. I want to fight her off, push her back, put up some kind of fight, but the kiss feels so good and Mia absolutely knows what she’s doing. Before I know it my hands are in her hair, holding it lightly in my closed fists as her tongue strokes into my mouth.

        She breaks the kiss and flashes me a devilish grin, eyes glinting mischievously. “I fucking knew it,” she says, dipping back in to kiss me again. “I knew I could have you so easily.”

        I want to be offended by what she’s saying, but she’s obviously right. Just a few kisses and I’m ready to strip. Mia quietly laughs and lifts me onto the counter. I’m only 5’2”, so it’s not much of a feat. She kisses me again, trailing kisses down to my neck where she bites me softly.

        “Mia,” I moan her name, rocking my hips against her.

        “Fuck,” She groans, kissing me hard. “You have no idea how many times I’d fantasize about hearing you say that.”

        “What?” I ask, breathless.

        “God, every time you’d drop Stacey off,” she pauses to rip away at the buttons on my top, “I saw every goodbye kiss that went on just a little too long, every time she’d reach down and grab this ass.” Mia punctuates that sentence by grabbing a handful. I have to admit, it’s a really nice ass.

        “Let’s go upstairs,” she tells me, not giving me a choice, even though we both know I could easily back out if I wanted to.

        I follow her up to her bedroom where a luxurious king-sized bed is sitting against the wall.

        “Strip.” She orders as she does the same, leaving a trail of clothes behind her.

        Once she’s naked, she crawls up the bed, sprawling out against the pillows and reaching a hand down to her pussy. She spreads her pussy lips and I can see how wet she is. Beckoning me forward with a finger, she begins to touch herself, circling her clit with her middle finger. “Come here.”

        Now naked, I obediently crawl up the bed. Though I was intending to kiss her again, she stops me with a hand on my shoulder. “Not so fast,” she says with a sultry laugh, “I want you to kiss me, but not on my mouth,” she guides me back down her body until my face is in front of her pussy. The smell of it turns me on; I have to take a moment to fight the dizziness. Without hesitation I dive in, kissing her on her clit before licking a stripe from her pussy hole back up. I roll her clit around with my tongue before sucking on it gently, pulsing my tongue against it as Mia writhes beneath me. “God, yes,” she moans, her fingers holding onto my blonde hair. “The only reason I was such a bitch to Stacey was that I wanted this so bad.” She grinds her hips against my mouth when I easily slide two fingers into her.

        When I hear Stacey’s name I’m amazed that I don’t falter at all in pleasing Mia. I don’t think I need to feel guilty, maybe this will finally solve her workplace problems.

        I rub at Mia’s walls with my fingers, loving the soaked sounds that come out of her pussy. “You’re gonna make me cum,” she tells me, hips rolling eagerly. I focus my efforts, sucking on her clit as my fingers press into her intently. I feel her pussy clench and clamp on my fingers as she cums, clit throbbing on my tongue. I keep at it until she pushes me away. “Lay on your back,” she instructs and I immediately do as I’m told.

        Mia lays on top of me and kisses me deep, her tongue searching my mouth. She sits up and positions her pussy over mine before lowering herself down. I gasp as our wet pussies meet, sliding against one another. “I hope you know that you’re gonna have to keep fucking me,” Mia says, breathless. “I’ll be nice to Stacey at work as long as we can keep meeting like this.” “Yes,” I answer immediately, not sure if I’m responding to her request or the movements of her hips. I grind against her, spreading my own legs further to be even closer. “If I had known it was gonna be this easy I would have tried you out months ago,” she laughs, getting off of me to lay beside me.

        She gathers me into her arms and kisses me hard as her hand spreads my legs. Her fingers are immediately in me, middle and ring fingers fucking me hard while her thumb rubs my clit. I can’t help the moan that escapes me. “Ooh, you like that?” She teases me, “You like cheating on your girlfriend with her boss?” My pussy clenches down at her words and she laughs, accepting that as a yes. “You’re such a dirty girl, Nyomi, she breathes against my ear, “letting me use you like this.” I don’t deny her words, my orgasm is quickly building and I don’t want her to stop. “Please,” I beg, meeting her eyes. Mia’s eyes widen as she looks down at me, hand speeding up. “Are you asking me for permission to cum?” She asks, grinning. “You are a sweet little thing, aren’t you?” She withdraws her fingers from my pussy and begins rubbing my clit hard and slow. “I’ll only let you cum if you promise to come over next week. Yes?” “Yes,” I nod my head, frantic. I’d do anything she asked of me in this moment. With a moan of approval Mia’s fingers speed up and before I know it I’m coming so hard I feel tears spring to my eyes. She doesn’t let up, rubbing hard at my clit until I’m squirming to get away. She removes her hand from my pussy and immediately shoves her fingers into her mouth. Before I realize what she’s doing her lips are back on mine, sharing the taste of my own orgasm. We get dressed in relative silence and she leads me back downstairs. Before I leave she pulls me in for one last kiss, grabbing my ass the same way she’d seen Stacey do. “See you next week,” she tells me, sending me on my way.

        Maybe I should feel bad about what I'd done, or about how excited I am to do it again, but really, this is all for Stacey. She’s going to have a better work-life now, and that’s because of me. Really she should be happy I cheated on her. I know I am.
